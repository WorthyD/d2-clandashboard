/**
 * NOTE: GroupQuery, as of Destiny 2, has essentially two totally different and incompatible \"modes\".  If you are querying for a group, you can pass any of the properties below.  If you are querying for a Clan, you MUST NOT pass any of the following properties (they must be null or undefined in your request, not just empty string/default values):  - groupMemberCountFilter - localeFilter - tagText  If you pass these, you will get a useless InvalidParameters error.
