 * Inventory Items can reward progression when actions are performed on them. A common example of this in Destiny 1 was Bounties, which would reward Experience on your Character and the like when you completed the bounty.  Note that this maps to a DestinyProgressionMappingDefinition, and *not* a DestinyProgressionDefinition directly. This is apparently so that multiple progressions can be granted progression points/experience at the same time.
