     * Firehose content is really a collection of metadata and \"properties\", which are the potentially-but-not-strictly localizable data that comprises the meat of whatever content is being shown.

They are JSON encoded, and could be JSON structures, simple strings, numbers etc... The Content Type of the item (cType) will describe the properties, and thus how they ought to be deserialized.
