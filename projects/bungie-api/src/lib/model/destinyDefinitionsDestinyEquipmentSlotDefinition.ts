 * Characters can not only have Inventory buckets (containers of items that are generally matched by their type or functionality), they can also have Equipment Slots.  The Equipment Slot is an indicator that the related bucket can have instanced items equipped on the character. For instance, the Primary Weapon bucket has an Equipment Slot that determines whether you can equip primary weapons, and holds the association between its slot and the inventory bucket from which it can have items equipped.  An Equipment Slot must have a related Inventory Bucket, but not all inventory buckets must have Equipment Slots.
