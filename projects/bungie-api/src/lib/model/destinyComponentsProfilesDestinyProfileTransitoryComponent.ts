 * This is an experimental set of data that Bungie considers to be \"transitory\" - information that may be useful for API users, but that is coming from a non-authoritative data source about information that could potentially change at a more frequent pace than Bungie.net will receive updates about it.  This information is provided exclusively for convenience should any of it be useful to users: we provide no guarantees to the accuracy or timeliness of data that comes from this source. Know that this data can potentially be out-of-date or even wrong entirely if the user disconnected from the game or suddenly changed their status before we can receive refreshed data.
