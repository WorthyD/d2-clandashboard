 * These definitions represent Factions in the game. Factions have ended up unilaterally being related to Vendors that represent them, but that need not necessarily be the case.  A Faction is really just an entity that has a related progression for which a character can gain experience. In Destiny 1, Dead Orbit was an example of a Faction: there happens to be a Vendor that represents Dead Orbit (and indeed, DestinyVendorDefinition.factionHash defines to this relationship), but Dead Orbit could theoretically exist without the Vendor that provides rewards.
